# **CritticWars DevBlog**

This site is for the developers of [CritticWars](https://www.critticwars.com), a text-based browser game to be able to post longer, detailed posts about the development progress of the site whilst keeping announcements in game shorter for players who may not be interested in the detai.

# Planning Phase

## Site Aims

CritticWars is a text based browser game that I have been developing. As part of the development process an announcement board is used to post updates that players can see upon logging into the game. However, I tend to keep these as short as possible as not all players like to see the extra detail of how and why a new feature was made, they just want to know its there and how to use it. 
The DevBlog was created to give the players that do want to see the extra information the opportunity to do so. 
The site aims to make it really easy to view the latest blogs and to dive into the blog and read comments. If a user wishes to do so they can then log in and post their own comments on each blog.
